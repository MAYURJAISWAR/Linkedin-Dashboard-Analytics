# Linkedin-Dashboard-Analytics

m proud to announce that I have created a comprehensive LinkedIn Dashboard Analytics to analyze my profile activity on the platform. This dashboard provides in-depth insights into various aspects of my LinkedIn presence, including the number of invitations sent and received, connections established, and messages exchanged.

The steps involves downloading the data from my LinkedIn account and loading it into Power BI, and then cleaning the data using the Power Query Editor.

The dashboard itself is designed to provide a visually appealing and easy-to-understand analysis of my LinkedIn activity. It includes various charts and graphs, such as pie charts and donut charts, that clearly represent the data and provide valuable insights. I also added a current date table, which displays the current date and time whenever the dashboard is refreshed. To further showcase my online presence, I included buttons linking to my LinkedIn and Github profiles, making it easy for viewers to access my professional online presence.
